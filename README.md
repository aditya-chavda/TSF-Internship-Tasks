# TSF-Internship-Tasks
A repository for showcasing the task to be performed as a data science intern at [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)

  * ### Exploring Supervised Learning

     This is the [*Task2*](https://github.com/aditya-chavda/TSF-Internship-Tasks/blob/master/Task2_TSF.ipynb) of the internship.
     
     Description: In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours he/she has studied. This is a simple linear regression task, as it involves just one variable.

  * ### Exploring Unsupervised Learning

     This is the [*Task3*](https://github.com/aditya-chavda/TSF-Internship-Tasks/blob/master/Task3_TSF.ipynb) of the internship.
     
     Description: In this task, from the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. K-means clustering has been used in this task.

  * ### Exploring Decision Tree

     This is the [*Task4*](https://github.com/aditya-chavda/TSF-Internship-Tasks/blob/master/Task4_TSF.ipynb) of the internship.
     
     Description: In this task, from the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we have to create and visualise a decision tree classification, and then predict right class on the new data.

  * ### Exploring Business Analytics

     This is the [*Task5*](https://github.com/aditya-chavda/TSF-Internship-Tasks/blob/master/Task5_TSF.ipynb) of the internship.
     
     Description: Supposing that we are the business owner of a retail firm, we are interested in seeing the company performance and the weak areas where more work is needed for making profit. The task is to derive business problems looking at the provided USA Superstore sample dataset.
