# TSF-Internship-Tasks
A repository for showcasing the task to be performed as a data science intern at [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)

  * ### Exploring Supervised Learning

     This is the [*Task2*](https://github.com/aditya-chavda/TSF-Internship-Tasks/blob/master/Task2_TSF.ipynb) of the internship.
     
     Description: In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours he/she has studied. This is a simple linear regression task, as it involves just one variable.

  * ### Exploring Unsupervised Learning

     This is the [*Task3*](https://github.com/aditya-chavda/TSF-Internship-Tasks/blob/master/Task3_TSF.ipynb) of the internship.
     
     Description: In this task, from the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. K-means clustering has been used in this task.
